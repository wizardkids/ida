        about()
            Information about the author and product.

        find_all_changes(myFeeds)
            Go through the RSS feeds in {myFeeds} and return a list of feeds that have changed since last access. Also return lists of changed sites, as well as lists of sites by status code.

        fold(txt)
            Utility function that textwraps 'txt' 45 characters wide.

        get_latest_feed(rss)
            Utility function to print information about a news feed. Used only by the developer.

        get_revision_number()
            Manually run this function to get a revision number by uncommenting
        the first line of code under "if __name__ == '__main__':"

        get_url_status(url)
            Get the status code for a URL.

        import_OPML()
            Parse an OPML file and put group names, RSS titles, and RSS addresses in {myFeeds} in the form {'Group name': [[title1, RSS1], [title2, RSS2]]}. If no filename is entered, process is aborted. If FileNotFoundError is generated, notify user and <continue>. With confirmation, this file
        is overwritten each time an OPML file is read.

            Output: {myFeeds} is written to myFeeds.json.

        inquire_feed(rss)
            Access a feed and return its status code.

        last_ten(rss)
            Return the titles of the latest ten pages for a website as a list of titles.

        pick_website()
            From a list of feeds, pick one and return the RSS address.

        print_all_functions()
            Print all the functions, with their docStrings, used in this program. This function is not used, except by the developer.

        retrieve_myFeeds()
            Read myFeeds.json and return a dictionary of the RSS feeds. Each key is a group and each value is a list of RSS feeds in that group. Each feed in 'value' contains two elements: title and RSS address.

        show_lastest_rss(rss)
            Show an RSS website in a browser window.
            
    -- import data from OPML file
    -- create myFeeds dictionary holding RSS data
    -- update myFeeds to include URL and a boolean for "marked" or "unmarked"
    -- print out myFeeds in a formatted list
    -- check a website for changes, returning status codes and sorting sites into "buckets" (lists) for status codes 200, 301, 302, 303, 304, 403, and 410

    -- complete add_feed(), allows user to add a feed. Includes ability to take website address and find the feed. This required feedburner_rss() and feed_xml() to get feeds generated by feedburner or some other xml utility.
    -- add a "Default" group to {myFeeds}
    -- add findfeed(), courtesy https://alex.miller.im/
    -- add del_feed(), allows user to delete a feed
    -- add clean_feeds(), cleans up {myFeeds} by deleting feeds with no title.

2019-06-26
    -- grouped functions (with labels) according to their function
    -- many minor/major edits
    -- fixed ability to add a new group
    -- add ability to list bad feeds
    -- instead of hashing titles in [titles_read], hash the URL to the page
    -- fix clean_feeds() so it gets rid of duplicate feeds (per group, only)

2019-06-27
    -- add find feed for youtube channels
    -- add clean_feeds() to add_feed()
    -- add move_feed() to move a feed from one group to another

2019-06-28
    -- fix move_feed() so it works correctly
    -- add removal of blank feeds in {myFeeds} in clean_feeds()
    -- add save_myFeeds() because several functions access this ability
    -- modify functions so that error messages are posted right above input() statements so that the user can easily notice them
    -- minor fixes to list_updated_feeds()
    -- when listing feeds after updating, list them by group
    -- added ability to edit a group name

2019-06-29
    -- when deleting a feed, provide a list of feeds, by group
    -- fix del_feed() so it works
    -- fix list_updated_feeds() so it lists groups/feeds correctly
    -- add <l> (list_updated_feeds()) and <g> (get_latest_feed()) to the menu, though the user is not given these shortcuts; for developer use only
    -- edited about() so that it prints version and revision numbers
    -- add ability to delete a group to rename_group()

2019-07-01
    -- modify {myFeeds} structure so that item #5 of each feed is a boolean that tracks whether or not the feed has been updated 
    -- modify get_latest_feed()
        -- so it is more efficient
        -- to update item #5 in {myFeeds} if a feed has changed; this is used in list_updated_feeds() to flag updated feeds
    -- modify list_updated_feeds() so it flags not only updated feeds, but posts that have not been read, yet
    -- fixed set_post_to_unread() and set_post_to_read() so they work properly
    -- added menu option to access list_my_feeds()
    -- fix list_my_feeds() so that it has a lot of the same functions as list_updated_feeds()
